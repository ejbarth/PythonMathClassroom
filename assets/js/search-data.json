            "content": "In my differential equations class, we use python for symbolic computation by default, explicitly calling on other libraries as needed. We&#39;ve written and collected a collection of utilities in the MATH280 module for some tasks that weren&#39;t implemented (to our knowledge) or felt awkward. We&#39;ll test drive a few of those features here as we explore the behavior of a 2-dimensional nonlinear equation. . from sympy import * import MATH280 . MATH280 . Some traditional symbolic analysis . We&#39;ll first define the symbolic system of nonlinear equations and use the symbolic solve() to find equilibrium solutions . x,y=symbols(&quot;x y&quot;) f1=-2*x-y**2 f2=x-2*y eqs=solve([f1,f2],[x,y]) eqs . [(-8, -4), (0, 0)] . We can symbolically generate the linearization matrix by manipulating our original functions $f_1(x,y)$ and $f_2(x,y)$ and check the eigenvalues at the equilibria, noting that $(0,0)$ is stable and $(8, -4)$ is an unstable saddle. . L=Matrix([[f1.diff(x),f1.diff(y)],[f2.diff(x),f2.diff(y)]]) L . $ displaystyle left[ begin{matrix}-2 &amp; - 2 y 1 &amp; -2 end{matrix} right]$ L.subs({x:eqs[1][0],y:eqs[1][1]}).eigenvals() . {-2: 2} . L.subs({x:eqs[0][0],y:eqs[0][1]}).eigenvals() . {-2*sqrt(2) - 2: 1, -2 + 2*sqrt(2): 1} . Especially when we can&#39;t find equilibrium solutions symbolically, zero isoclines can be really helpful in understanding qualitative behavior of solutions, and the task requires less from solve() . isocline1=solve(f1,y) isocline2=solve(f2,y) isocline1, isocline2 . ([-sqrt(2)*sqrt(-x), sqrt(2)*sqrt(-x)], [x/2]) . We can use the sympy plot() to draw the graphs of the symbolic zero isocline expressions returned by solve() . plot(isocline1[0], isocline1[1], isocline2[0], xlim=(-10,1),line_color=&quot;blue&quot;) . &lt;sympy.plotting.plot.Plot at 0x1ebd30665f0&gt; . Direction Fields for Symbolic Expressions . In the MATH280 module, we&#39;ve included a direction field plotter drawdf() that bridges the symbolic/numeric divide. drawdf() takes a symbolic expression and draws a direction field plot using numerical data generated behind the scenes. An axis handle is returned so that further changes to the plot can be made. Below, we draw the direction field for the 2D system, along with a few representative solutions using the soln_at option. Then the zero isoclines are plotted on the same set of axes. . from numpy import linspace, sqrt xx=linspace(-10,0,100) ax=MATH280.drawdf([f1,f2],[x,-10,1],[y,-6,1],soln_at=[[-8,1],[2,-5],[-4,-6]]) ax.plot(xx,xx/2,&quot;b--&quot;) ax.plot(xx,-sqrt(2)*sqrt(-xx),&quot;r-.&quot;,xx,sqrt(2)*sqrt(-xx),&quot;r-.&quot;) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x1ebe3d0f310&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x1ebe3d0f430&gt;] . Numerical Solution for Symbolic Equations . We&#39;d like to have the ability to easily call for a numerical solution of symbolic equation. In the MATH280 module, we&#39;ve included two numerical solvers (based on scipy.integrate.solve_ivp()) that, like: drawdf() bridge the symbolic/numeric divide: . rkf45(symbolic_rhs_expression,dep_vars_list,dep_vars_initvals,ind_var_list): for general use | BDF(symbolic_rhs_expression,dep_vars_list,dep_vars_initvals,ind_var_list): for equations known to be stiff | . t=symbols(&quot;t&quot;) ns=MATH280.rkf45([f1,f2],[x,y],[-3,2],[t,0,10]) . Having jumped the gap from symbolics and numerics, the output ns is a list of numerical arrays. We&#39;ll plot with matplotlib . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot(ns[0],ns[1][0],ns[0],ns[1][1]) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x1ebe3e09870&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x1ebe3e098d0&gt;] . Of course, we could call solve_ivp() directly with a defined right-hand-side function: . def vrhs(t,xy): return [-2*xy[0]-xy[1]**2, xy[0] - 2*xy[1]] from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp nsol=solve_ivp(vrhs,[0, 5],[2,-2]) . plt.plot(nsol.t,nsol.y[0]) plt.plot(nsol.t,nsol.y[1]) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x1ebe3e70d30&gt;] .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .

Since 2016, I’ve been using the free open-source computer algebra system Maxima in the ODEs course. To document the learning my students and I have done in Maxima, I created the blog TheMaximalist.org. That site serves my needs by giving me a place to write down the things we learn so that my students and I can refer back to them. Over the years, that site has become a little bit popular with other Maxima users around the world, getting about 30,000 visits a year. . Two things that bug me about Maxima: . There isn’t an obvious way for novices to install Maxima in macOS — that affects about half my students in each class. | Maxima has a small enough user base that my students don’t get much resume “wow” from their experience in that platform. | . A few months ago a student mentioned that she was planning to spend some time learning Python before she started applying for jobs after graduation.
