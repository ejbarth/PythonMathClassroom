This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].

I teach lots of undergraduate students each year in Ordinary Differential Equations, Multivariable Calculus, Complex Variables, and Applied Statistics.  Since 2016, I've been using the free open-source computer algebra system Maxima in the ODEs course.  To document the learning my students and I have done in Maxima, I created the blog **[TheMaximalist.org](https://"TheMaximalist.org")



[^1]:a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.
